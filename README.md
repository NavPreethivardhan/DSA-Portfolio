# DSA-Portfolio-by-Nav-Preethivardhan

## Overview
This repository showcases my selected LeetCode solutions, organized by algorithm category and annotated with detailed problem statements, solution approaches, and complexity analyses. It reflects my ongoing journey in mastering data structures and algorithms as part of my preparation for a top-tier MS application.

## Goals
- Demonstrate proficiency in core DSA patterns and techniques  
- Provide clear, well-documented solutions for educational review  
- Track progress with a public portfolio that evolves weekly  
- Build a strong foundation for machine learning and system design
